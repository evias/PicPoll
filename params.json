{"name":"Picpoll","tagline":"PicPoll is a nodeJS + Parse CloudCode App with Pictures Polls features (Voting & Statistics)","body":"## evias/PicPoll\r\nPicPoll is a Parse CloudCode App providing with CloudCode Functions\r\nand a nodeJS (+ express) web application. This package provides with \r\nPic of the Month features such as Voting, Statistics, Hot for the\r\nMoment and Hashtag features.\r\n\r\nA Demo of this App deployed to a Parse Hosting can be found at following\r\nURL : https://picpoll.parseapp.com\r\n\r\nDeployment is very easy as the App can be deployed on the free Parse.com\r\ntiers. You'll find more informations about this here: https://www.parse.com/docs/cloudcode\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nPlease make sure to have the Parse Command-Line Tools installed and configured\r\nas described here: https://www.parse.com/docs/cloudcode/guide#command-line\r\n\r\nFor this installation example I will assume that you have already created\r\na Parse App with the name \"myPicPollApp\".\r\n\r\nFirst thing to do to be able to install the PicPoll App is to clone\r\nthe git repository with the source code.\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/evias/PicPoll.git\r\n    $ cd PicPoll\r\n\r\nNow that you have the source code, you will see a public/ directory and a\r\ncloud/ directory. These two directories are important for the CloudCode API\r\nprovided by Parse.com. See following link for more details about CloudCode\r\nApps on Parse: https://www.parse.com/docs/cloudcode/guide\r\n\r\nThe last step of the installation is to deploy the application to the Parse\r\nApp \"myPicPollApp\" you created earlier. The command-line tools from Parse\r\nmake this process very easy:\r\n\r\n    $ parse new -a myPicPollApp\r\n    $ parse deploy myPicPollApp\r\n\r\nYour Feedback Management app is now online !\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n    * jQuery 1.11\r\n    * Parse CloudCode\r\n\r\n### Hints / Advices\r\nUsing git, when you will modify your .parse.local file of the clone in order\r\nto configure your parse command line tools to use your own Parse App, git will\r\nsee the .parse.local file as modified. To avoid having to communicate my Parse\r\nApp details, I use following command to mark the .parse.local file unchanged:\r\n\r\n    $ git update-index [--assume-unchanged|--no-assume-unchanged]\r\n\r\n### Git Branching\r\n2 git branches will usually be updated in this repository, being the branch\r\n*master* for releases (see git tags) and the branch *develop* for development\r\nof features. Hotfixes might branch from *master* but will usually be tackled\r\nfrom a *develop* branch or sub-branch.\r\n\r\n### Support / Contact\r\nYou can contact me anytime at my e-mail address and I will be glad to answer\r\nany type of questions related to this project.\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome if you see anything missing or have detected a\r\nbug, want to develop a new API class, or whatever, I will be glad to respond\r\nto pull requests!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nGreg\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
